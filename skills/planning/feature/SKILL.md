# Feature Planning

Use this skill when implementing NEW functionality or capabilities.

<IMPORTANT>
**Prerequisites:** Invoke `planning/base` skill first if not already loaded. It provides the core planning phases (0-5).

Follow all base planning rules, plus the feature-specific rules below.
</IMPORTANT>

## Feature-Specific Requirements

### Changelog Summary

Every new feature MUST include a changelog summary. After analysis, create a concise summary:

```markdown
## Changelog Entry

### Added
- <Brief description of the new feature>
- <User-facing benefit or capability>
```

This summary will be added to CHANGELOG.md upon completion.

### Test Case Consideration

After COMPLETING the feature implementation, ASK the user:

> "Feature implementation is complete. Would you like me to add unit tests?
> - Which components/functions should be tested?
> - Are there specific edge cases to cover?"

If user requests tests:
1. Invoke the testing skill: `testing/gtest-gmock` (C++) or `testing/pytest` (Python)
2. Follow the test planning process from that skill
3. Write tests ONE BY ONE, waiting for user approval after each test

### Pull Request

After tests (if any), ASK the user:

> "Ready to create a Pull Request. Should I proceed?"

If yes, invoke `git/pull-request` skill and create PR with:
- **Motivation** - Why this feature is needed
- **Technical Details** - What was implemented
- **Test Plan** - How it was tested

## Plan File Format

Save to `planning/feature-<name>.md`:

```markdown
# Feature: <Feature Name>

## Goal
<Original user request>

## Changelog Summary
### Added
- <Feature description>

## Analysis
<Key findings, scope, dependencies, risks>

## PR Strategy
<Single PR or split? If split, list each PR with scope>

### PR 1: <Title> (if multiple PRs)
**Scope:** <What's included>
**Estimated size:** ~X lines

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Task 3
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md

## Test Cases
- [ ] <Test type>: <Test description>
(or "No tests requested")

## Notes
<Any additional context or decisions>
```

## Example

**User request:** "Add user profile avatar upload"

```markdown
# Feature: User Profile Avatar Upload

## Goal
Add ability for users to upload and display profile avatars

- [ ] Implement image validation and resizing
- [ ] Update ProfileSettings to include avatar section
- [ ] Add avatar display to user profile header
