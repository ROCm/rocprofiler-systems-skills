# Bugfix Planning

Use this skill when fixing bugs, errors, or unexpected behavior.

<IMPORTANT>
Follow all base planning rules from `planning/base`, plus the bugfix-specific rules below.
</IMPORTANT>

## Bugfix-Specific Requirements

### Root Cause Analysis

Before proposing fixes, identify:

1. **What is the bug?** - Exact symptoms and error messages
2. **Where does it occur?** - Specific file, function, line
3. **Why does it happen?** - Root cause, not just symptoms
4. **When was it introduced?** - If known, helps understand context

### Changelog Consideration

After analysis, ASK the user:

> "Should this bugfix be added to the changelog?
> - Yes: If it's a user-facing bug that affected functionality
> - No: If it's an internal fix or minor issue
>
> Add to changelog? (yes/no)"

If yes, include changelog entry:

```markdown
## Changelog Entry

### Fixed
- <Brief description of what was broken and how it's fixed>
```

### Regression Prevention

After COMPLETING the bugfix, ASK the user:

> "Bugfix is complete. Would you like me to add a regression test to prevent this bug from recurring?"

If user agrees:
1. Read the testing skill: `testing/unit-tests`
2. Create a test that specifically reproduces the bug scenario
3. Verify the test would have failed before the fix
4. Wait for user approval of the test

### Pull Request

After tests (if any), ASK the user:

> "Ready to create a Pull Request. Should I proceed?"

If yes, read `git/pull-request` skill and create PR with:
- **Motivation** - What bug was fixed and its impact
- **Technical Details** - Root cause and fix
- **Test Plan** - Regression test that prevents recurrence

## Plan File Format

Save to `planning/bugfix-<name>.md`:

```markdown
# Bugfix: <Bug Description>

## Problem
<What is broken, error messages, symptoms>

## Root Cause
<Why the bug occurs>

## Analysis
<Affected files, related code, risks of fix>

## Tasks
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2
- [ ] Verify fix works

## Changelog
<Entry if requested, or "Not added to changelog">

## Regression Test
<Test description if requested, or "No regression test">

## Notes
<Any additional context>
```

## Example

**User request:** "Fix login timeout - users getting logged out after 5 minutes"

**Planning output:**

```markdown
# Bugfix: Premature Session Timeout

## Problem
Users are being logged out after 5 minutes instead of the expected 30 minutes.
Error: "Session expired" toast appears unexpectedly.

## Root Cause
Token refresh interval was set to 5 minutes (300000ms) but the condition 
checked for token age > 5 minutes, causing immediate refresh failure loop.

## Analysis
- File: src/auth/tokenService.ts, line 45
- The refresh check uses `>` instead of `>=`, causing edge case failure
- Risk: Low - isolated fix in token handling

## Tasks
- [ ] Fix comparison operator in tokenService.ts
- [ ] Verify token refresh works correctly
- [ ] Update CHANGELOG.md

## Changelog
### Fixed
- Session timeout now correctly respects 30-minute duration

## Regression Test
- [ ] Unit: Token refresh timing edge cases

## Notes
- Also found: TOKEN_REFRESH_INTERVAL constant should be moved to config
```
